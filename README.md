This repository has some of my college works that I found interesting.

<li>
  <ul><b>teoriaComp:</b>Two projects in Python. The first one needs to receive an input to work, and the second one expects to receive a file to work. The objective of the projects is validate the inputs using Regex.</ul>
</li>
